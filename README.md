Etch-A-Sketch
Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs  using JavaScript DOM manipulation technique.
Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them.
Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
